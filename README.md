# crud-notes
a system a CRUD web application capable of creating, editing and deleting notes from its different registered users

After spending a few weeks learning Javascript, I decided to validate my knowledge by creating an implementation that 
can Create, Read, Update, Delete and View Data (CRUD) using only JS technologies.

## Implementation Dependecies:
- express: as backed server
- express-handlebars: as views engine
- mongodb: as nosql database
- mongoose: as object document modeling tool
- express-session: to keep and configure live sessions
- method-override: to extend the http methods functions
- passport & passport-local: to configure the authentication strategy
- bcryptjs: why keeping passwords in plain text is just stupid ;^)
- connect-flash: to print some notifications on the fronted in a comfortable way

## how to run
~~~
npm test

this is my first full project on both javascript and github. I would greatly appreciate your suggestions and recommendations, and if you thought it was a good project, do not forget to give me an star

to be continue....
